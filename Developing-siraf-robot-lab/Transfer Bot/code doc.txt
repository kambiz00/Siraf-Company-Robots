The code Python script that performs some data processing tasks using pandas and openpyxl libraries. It defines a class called Transfer, which has several methods for creating different sheets and files based on the provided data.

However, I noticed that there are some imports missing in the code snippet you provided. Please make sure to include all the necessary import statements at the beginning of your script. Additionally, the code refers to some external modules like config, cli, and log_time. You need to make sure these modules are available and properly imported.
